This project is a digital implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, allowing two players to compete by marking "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. Key features include:

Interactive Gameplay: Players take alternate turns to select empty cells until one wins or the game ends in a tie.
Win Detection: Automatically detects winning combinations (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) and announces the result.
Reset Option: Allows players to restart the game for continuous play.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and responsive design for a seamless user experience.
